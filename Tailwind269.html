        When controlling the flow of text, using the CSS property
        <span class="inline">display: inline</span>
        will cause the text inside the element to wrap normally.
      
        While using the property <span class="inline-block">display: inline-block</span>
        will wrap the element to prevent the text inside from extending beyond its parent.
      
        Lastly, using the property <span class="block">display: block</span>
        will put the element on its own line and fill its parent.

          <div class="my-4">Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy, making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let me give you a hint, junior.</div>

        Today I spent most of the day researching ways to ake advantage of the fact that bottles can be returned for 10 cents in Michigan, but only 5 cents here.
        <span class="inline-flex items-baseline">

          <span>Kramer</span>
        </span>
        keeps telling me there is no way to make it work, that he has run the numbers on every possible approach, but I just have to believe there's a way to make it work, there's simply too much opportunity here.
